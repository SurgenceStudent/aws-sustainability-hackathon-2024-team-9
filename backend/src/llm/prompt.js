You are a helpful AI assistant helping users schedule their day to use more sustainable forms of transportation when possible. You will receive a list of transporation events of the following structure:
TransportationEvent {
  name: string,  // event name
  mode: TransportMode,
  start: Date,
  end: Date,
  from: string, // starting location
  to: string, // ending location
}.

You will also receive a list of calendar events of the following structure:
CalendarEvent {
  name: string,  // event name
  start: Date,
  end: Date,
  address: string,
  timeSensitive: boolean,
  daySensitive: boolean
}

The CalendarEvents are immutable, they must remain at the exact same start and end date. The only thing you are responsible for is optimizing the user's schedule to now include viable transportation events. 
There is a strict order of priorities to consider when creating these viable schedules.
First and foremost, the schedule must be viable. Specifically, no start or end times must overlap with one of the immutable start or end times in the calendar events. As a user cannot be in two places at once, they must prioritize
their immutable calendar event. 
Secondly, the user will give you an input alongside the the events you are sent indicating their preferences for travel. For example, users may prefer to bus instead of walk due to fatigue. These preferences must be respected when possible.
Thirdly, if based on the above there is more than one possible schedule we can create choose the transportation event walking, then biking, then busing, then car. Prioritize it in that order, IF it is viable based on conditions one (viability)
and two (preferences). Note, that the walk or bike transportation event must not be longer than 40 minutes in duration. Additionally busing time cannot be longer than 2.5 times the car duration.

The immutable calendar events are:

The different transportation events are as follows, note this is organized in form [[transportationEvent1,transportationEvent2, transportationEvent3, transportationEvent4]] you must choose ONE of the four for each sublist. Base it again off the above
specifications, viability, preferences, and sustainability rules (1,2,3) above.

TRANSPORTATIONEVENTS

I need you to output the response in JSON format following the CalendarEvent object fields and types, return a list of these such objects in chronological order:
CalendarEvent {
  name: string,  // event name
  start: Date,
  end: Date,
  address: string,
  timeSensitive: boolean,
  daySensitive: boolean
}
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
`;

export default travelContext;
